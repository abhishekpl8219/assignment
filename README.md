This assignment uses **React** as the tech stack and implements several React functionalities such as **pagination**, **Context API**, and a **dropdown menu**.

It contains **two pages**:  
- One page has **bar and pie charts**.  
- The other page contains a **table**.  

Cypress test cases have also been added to the project to ensure some functionalities are tested.

On the **left side** of the application, links for both pages (**PAGE1** and **PAGE2**)
